# Jason's Writing Samples For Research

## Sample 1: R_Code
This sample is an R script from my Viper Research. This script is designed for use on STACKS processed RADseq data, and thus was the final step in many months of analysis. The code deals with visualization of the results of the genetic analysis data. This analysis suggests there are multiple distinct populations of vipers within the sample tested.

## Sample 2: Raiti_et_al
This sample is the most complete piece of research writing I have done to date. This sample is a poster I presented as part of my research with the Biology Department at FSU. I traveled to present at the Florida Undergraduate Research Conference in 2020, as well as for conferences hosted by Florida State University.
