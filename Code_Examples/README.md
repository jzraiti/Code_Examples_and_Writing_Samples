# Jason's Writing Samples For Research

## Sample 1: R Code from research
This sample is an R script from my Viper Research. This script is designed for use on STACKS processed RADseq data, and thus was the final step in many months of analysis. The code deals with visualization of the results of the genetic analysis data. This analysis suggests there are multiple distinct populations of vipers within the sample tested.

## Sample 2: Building Support Vector Machine in Matlab 
This sample is a personal project I did in Matlab to teach myself how to use Matlab's object oriented capabilities. There are function and class definitions in the files addGate.m , Circuit.m , multiplyGate.m , sigmoidGate.m , SVM.m , and Unit.m .

The main script of this project is contained in Object_Oriented_Neural_Network.m . 

## Note
For examples of python and C scripts I have written outside of class, please take a look at the code written for my project for NASA:

I did not include this code because it cannot be run without significant hardware setup and installation of dependencies.
